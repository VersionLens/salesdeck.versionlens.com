* CEO - Should be human



## Problem

## Competition 

No direct competitor yet. But we expect competition soon.

#### Potential competitors:

* Accenture / IBM / Fiverr <!-- .element: class="fragment" style="font-size: 34px" -->
  * Will have to fire their human consultants.
* Microsoft / OpenAI / Github / Google <!-- .element: class="fragment" style="font-size: 34px" -->
  * Will depend on their own models. We will use the best for the job.
* Copilot / Replit.com <!-- .element: class="fragment" style="font-size: 34px" -->
  * Need human developers present all the time. We don't.
* Release.com <!-- .element: class="fragment" style="font-size: 34px" -->
  * They are "environments as a service" and would add AI on top. We are AI first.
* Startups <!-- .element: class="fragment" style="font-size: 34px;" -->
